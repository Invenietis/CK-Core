###CK.Core###
Contains several helper classes and interfaces.

One of the most useful and interesting aspect is the ReadOnly and Writable List &amp; Collections (and other Sorted / Observable implementations) objects that have been designed from the ground up to support co and contra variance.

As of 2.8.6 version, CK.Core is 4.0 / 4.5 compliant: in .Net 4.5 *System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyCollection&lt;T&gt;* and *System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList&lt;T&gt;* appeared in the mscorlib (but without the contravariant Contains and IndexOf that we had in CK.Core). The package now contains the libs and CK.Core related objects have been prefixed with CK (to avoid any other name clash in the future).

Another important component is the ActivityLogger: it offers a different way than traditional  loggers (log4net, NLog, etc.) to capture program's activities and structure them.
ActivityLogger uses CKTrait to handle the combination of different tags in a determinist manner. 
Traits are normalized (*"Sql|DB access|Subscription" == "DB access|Sql|Subscription"* and *"DB access|Sql" > "Sql"*): a total order exists on the set of traits combinations based on lexicographical order for atomic trait and the number of traits in a composite. They support union, intersect, except and symmetric except in O(n).
